# My Spotify Playlist Generator

## Description
This is my first project. Because I love discovering new songs to add to my playlist, I decided to work with Spotify. My decision to turn it into a discord bot was merely because I did not want to create an entire website for something so simplistic and minimal. This was a great learning experience for me, working with APIs and working with git (I practically have no git experience as of right now).

## Features
* Generates a playlist baseed on user entered keyword
* Delete playlists from your Spotify library (be careful with this one)
* View top played songs ranging from 4 weeks, 6 months, and a year

## Known Flaws
* All Spotify API requests are blocking, with playlist generation being the most blocking 
* Messy in `slash_commands.py`

## Conclusion
I have decided not to fix these flaws and move on to the next project. These flaws are mainly due to not planning anything. I understand the importance of carefully considering the layout for projects to follow and how it will effect future code after hours of going back and forth rewriting code upon realizing it didn't work for the code I was writing at the time.
